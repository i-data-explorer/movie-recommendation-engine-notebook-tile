A recommendation engine, provides a selection of items to a user, based on the user's preferences. In this notebook, we've built a movie recommendation engine, which essentially works by suggesting movies watched by other users with similar "watch history".

We will be using a MovieLens dataset. This dataset contains 100004 ratings across 9125 movies for 671 users. All selected users had at least rated 20 movies. We are going to build a recommendation engine which will suggest movies for a user which he hasn't watched yet based on the movies which he has already rated. We will be using k-nearest neighbour algorithm which we will implement from scratch.
