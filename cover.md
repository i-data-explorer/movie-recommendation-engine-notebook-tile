## What is the notebook about?
In this notebook, we've built a movie recommendation engine, which essentially works by suggesting movies rated by other users with a similar "watch profile".

## What algorithms are used?
We will be using the K-Nearest Neighbour algorithm which shall be implemented from scratch.

## What is the content of the notebook?
The notebook uses a MovieLens dataset. This dataset contains 100004 ratings across 9125 movies for 671 users. All selected users had at least rated 20 movies. We will build a recommendation engine, training the KNN model using the MovieLens Dataset, which will recommend movies for a user, which they haven't watched yet.
